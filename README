------------

- Custom Password: You can provide a custom password so you don't have to enter
  your user password on the X server. Simply create a ~/.slock_passwd file with
  your separate password in it.

- Alarms: A siren will play if a user enters an incorrect password. It must
  reside in ~/slock.

- Automatic Shutdown: Your machine will immediately shutdown if:

  1. The wrong password is entered more than 5 times.

  2. ALT/CTRL/F1-F13 is pressed to switch VTs or to try to kill the X server.
     Also, if ALT+SYSRQ is attempted to be used.

  - Automatic shutdown requires a sudoers option to be set in /etc/sudoers:

    [user] [host] =NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl poweroff,/usr/bin/systemctl halt,/usr/bin/systemctl reboot

    You must change [user] and [host] to your username and the hostname of the
    machine. Note that this only works with systemd, however, it could be
    modified for a regular init by using the shutdown command.

- Twilio Support: You will receive an SMS to your phone when someone inputs a
  wrong password or pressed ALT/CTRL/F1-13/SYSRQ. See twilio_example.h to create a
  twilio.h file. You will need a twilio account to set this up.
